# Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency

A concurrency framework for building real time systems.

Formerly known as Real-Time For the Masses.

## Features

- **Tasks** as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be *event triggered*
  (fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on
  demand.

- **Message passing** between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to
  software tasks at spawn time.

- **A timer queue** [^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time
  in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.

- Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus, **preemptive multitasking**.

- **Efficient and data race free memory sharing** through fine grained *priority
  based* critical sections [^1].

- **Deadlock free execution** guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger
  guarantee than what's provided by [the standard `Mutex`
  abstraction][std-mutex].

[std-mutex]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html

- **Minimal scheduling overhead**. The task scheduler has minimal software
  footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.

- **Highly efficient memory usage**: All the tasks share a single call stack and
  there's no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.

- **All Cortex-M devices are fully supported**.

- This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis
  and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven't yet developed Rust
  friendly tooling for that.)

## Requirements

- Rust 1.41.0+

- Applications must be written using the 2018 edition.
